# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I am Nicolai

## About me

I am a developer, people leader and passionate about continuous learning, software security and great engineering.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to lead teams of engineers and best help them to continuously improve their skills.

ðŸ‘¾ I love gaming of all kinds, including boardgames, computer games and tabletop roleplaying games.

ðŸ“š I am also an avid reader of sci-fi, fantasy and various non-fiction.

ðŸŽ£ I tend to collect hobbies and never have enough time to explore them all, but something that has stuck with me, and greatly helps me de-stress, is fishing!
